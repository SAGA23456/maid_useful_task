# Maid Useful Tasks

如果需要中文，请访问 [中文版](Readme_zh.md)

An extension mod of TLM(Touhou Little Maid). Add some useful tasks to your Maid.

# Features

## Logging

The maid will cut down the logs around her and plant saplings. You can give the maid an axe and hoe or scissors to speed
up the maid's ability to cut down trees and destroy leaves!

## Locate 

The maid will search for a specified structure or the player's respawn point based on the item in her hand. If the maid is on the same vehicle as the player (currently only brooms are supported), the player can press a designated button (V by default) to give the maid control or partial control of the carrier.

## Revive

Requires "Player Revive" mod.

The Maid will revive nearby fallen players. If there is an undead totem in the Maid's bauble, the Maid will use one (The maid consumes a totem to skip your revive countdown, instead of just consuming the totem to not die like that in vanilla).
